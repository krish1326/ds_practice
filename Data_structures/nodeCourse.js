/**
 * machines will understand the language called as machine language which is hard to interpret so we
 * develop engines to work with the microprocessors to make the commands work for us internally through
 * microprocessors.
 * 
 * v8 engine => c/c++ => Machine language => System operations 
 * 
 * v8 is one of the many javascript engines which was developed by chrome, which was developed using c++
 * which is opensource project and can be used in another programs.
 * 
 *
 * we can use v8 to get embedded so as to add new features on top of that to get additional capabilities 
 * is we get node Js.
 * 
 * Servers and Clients:(client-server model of computing)
 * server a computer that perfoms services.
 * clients ==> consumes the services and display to the users.
 * 
 * javascript does'nt have some of the features that are not part of any engine they are provided 
 * by browsers.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * supervised Learning : depends on the person who teaches ==> here we will teach to learn.
 * unsupervised learning: it is based on the system's capability. it is crude form of learning
 * Reinforced learning: here we train with constant feedback. self learning car, deepmind, gaming works on this pattern 
 * where the constant learning is done.
 * Anomaly Detection

 * 
 * Modules: Moldules are the blocks of code which are useful and will never impact other parts of code.
 * 
 * node js implements commonjs modules,==> these are set of rules that the code should be structured.
 * 
 * Name value pair:
 * Name which references to a value
